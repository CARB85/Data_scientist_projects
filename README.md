### Project Description

This project analyzes online music streaming data to compare user behavior between two cities: Springfield and Shelbyville. The main objective is to test the hypothesis that **user activity varies depending on the day of the week and the city**.

The analysis is divided into three stages:

- **Data Description**: Initial exploration and key observations.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, including handling column names, duplicates, and missing values.  
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Evaluating the proposed hypothesis through data analysis.  

### Data

The data is stored in the `/datasets/music_project_en.csv` file and includes the following columns:

- **userID**: Unique identifier for each user.  
- **Track**: Song title.  
- **artist**: Artist name.  
- **genre**: Music genre.  
- **City**: User's city.  
- **time**: Time the track was played (HH:MM:SS).  
- **Day**: Day of the week.  

This analysis will provide valuable insights into the differences in music preferences between the two cities.
