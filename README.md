## Project Description

You are working for the online store *Ice*, which sells video games worldwide. User and expert reviews, game genres, platforms (such as Xbox or PlayStation), and historical sales data are available from open sources. Your task is to identify patterns that determine whether a game is successful or not. This will allow you to detect promising projects and plan advertising campaigns.

You have data going back to 2016. Imagine it's December 2016, and you are planning a campaign for 2017.

The important part of the project is to gain experience working with data. It doesn't really matter whether you are forecasting 2017 sales based on 2016 data or 2027 sales based on 2026 data.

The dataset contains a "rating" column, which stores the ESRB rating of each game. The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) evaluates the content of a game and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Adult.

## Instructions for Completing the Project

### Step 1: Open the data file and explore the general information

File path:  
`/datasets/games.csv` â€” Download the dataset.

### Step 2: Prepare the data

### Step 3: Analyze the data

### Step 4: Create a user profile for each region

### Step 5: Test the following hypotheses:

- The average user ratings for Xbox One and PC platforms are the same.
- The average user ratings for Action and Sports genres are different.

Set the alpha threshold yourself.

Explain:
- How you formulated the null and alternative hypotheses.
- The criteria you used to test the hypotheses and why.

### Step 6: Write a general conclusion
